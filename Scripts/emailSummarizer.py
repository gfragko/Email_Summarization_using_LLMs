I will provide a piece of email conversation along with the attached files and then a summary of these pieces of text.

---
email_text:
{email_text}

---
Attached files:
{attachments_text}

---
Summary:
{summary_text}

I want the summary text to contains all important details about the ids of the shipments and their statuses (if any) are present or other document ids or even changes of plans!
I want you to review how good the summary is based on the rules above. 
Provide comments on how it could be better and create a new summary.
Finally provide a new prompt to feed into Ollama that you think would achieve a better summarization (not just for this specific example).
